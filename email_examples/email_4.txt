Hi Team,

We are excited to invite you to our annual company picnic, which will be held this Saturday at Central Park from 11 AM to 4 PM. This is a great opportunity to relax, meet colleagues from different departments, and enjoy some fun outdoor activities.

The event will include games, a barbecue, and a raffle with exciting prizes. Families are welcome, so feel free to bring your loved ones. We encourage everyone to RSVP by Thursday so we can finalize the catering and activities.

Looking forward to seeing you all there for a day of fun and camaraderie!

Best,
HR Department
